# Hack Club QR code keychain
I made a 3D printable QR code that alsso serves as a key chain so you can take it whereever you go in order to recruit more hacker to be a part of the community!

## Description
This was also made in one day, but I've enjoyed designing the print.
Luckily I knew a bit about common CAD errors, and one came up during this project (non-manifold parts), and I was able to deal with it with efficiency.
If you look closely, you can see a small but noticeable "h engraving" on the QR code, representing hack club's logo (the "h"h is the logo, I'm pretty sure)!

## Installation
I'll say the same thing that I said in my other 3D print repo:
Just download the file!
Also, if you're new to 3D printing, look for tutorials online or maybe even join the hack club slack (https://hackclub.com) for more "presonalized" help :)

## Usage
It's a keychain; put it somewhere where anyone can see!
Your school's bulletin board (with permission), locker, bracelet (depends on size), or even as one of those things that you hang on your rear view mirror!

## Features
It has a hole for the rope of chain or whatever you use to keep the keychain connected.
I'll make sure that the QR code is readable, and if it isn't send me a message or I might've have noticed it myself and am already working on making a more readable one :)

## Contributing
You can make your own version of it!
Feel free to send me your version of the print if you make one that's better though
